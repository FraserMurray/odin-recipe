    <h3>Ingredients Include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 small onions, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 fat garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <li>140g cooking chorizo, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>pinch of saffron</li>
        <li>1sp paprika</li>
        <li>300g paella rice</li>
        <li>850ml hot chicken or vegtable stock</li>
        <li>200g frozen peas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a deep frying pan over a high heat. Brown the chicken all over – don’t cook completely. Once browned, transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, add the onions and cook slowly until softened, about 10 mins. Add the garlic, stir for 1 min, then toss in the chorizo and fry until it releases its oils.</li>
        <li>Stir in the spices, then tip in the rice. Stir to coat the rice in the oils and spices for about 2 mins, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, return the chicken to the pan and simmer for about 20 mins, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the peas to the pan and simmer for a further 5 mins until the rice is cooked and the chicken is tender. Season well and serve with the lemon and parsley.</li>
    </ol>
